RMI or better known as Remote Method Invocation is an API
provided by JAVA for developing distributed applications.
With RMI we are able to invoke (call) a method within another
JVM instance.


Let's explore the code you're going to run.

########### Responses.java

We need to create an interface that discloses what methods we can
expect to be available to any class that extends it. This class must
also extend the Remote object as it will be comes itself a passable
remote object.

    sayHello(); - To provide a response to the client. Simulates
    a response from Server that is connected to a database (JDBC)

########### Servant.java

The code in this block is where the implementation takes life. It
extends the UnicastRemoteObject which aids us in  exporting a remote
object with JRMP and obtaining a stub that communicates to the remote
object.

The method sayHello() - returns a response such as "Hello World!".
